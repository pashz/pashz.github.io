    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring Data Scientist in Toronto.</p>
    <p>I like being AWARE and indulge with the right ATTITUDE to anything I associate myself with!</p>
    <p>I have finished a Diploma in Applied Data Science & Big Data at WeCloudData and a degree in Aerospace Enineering & Astronautics from Kingston University, London, UK.</p>
    <p>There is something about a Big Occasion or a Crisis that brings out the best, and even some times the worst, in a person, my diverse education work and extensive travelling, 
      settling and resettling within different cultures, has got me well versed in dealing with situations requiring immediate attention, prioritizing tasks aptly, and being swift to 
      learn new systems. On a more personal level, to help achieve goals collectively within an Iterative Process , I believe I am a good team player, compassionate and sociable and easy 
      to collaborate with, which is essential when taking into account the many complex issues that may arise in planning Innovation, at its befitting time!</p>
    <p>I love travelling, its how I appease myself, getting a dose of otherness, investing in my future self. I have studied and worked in USA, Sweden, Germany, Dubai, different parts of the UK & India.</p>
    <p>My last position was at Bombardier Aerospace, as a Methods Analyst for the Cockpit Team, of the GLOBAL 7500 Business Aircrafts. I have 5+ years of experience within the Manufacturing Sector.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a Data Science Intern at Beam Data in Toronto.</p>
